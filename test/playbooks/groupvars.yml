          ### Playbook used to explain groupvars search.
          
          * Allow to choose value.s among a list aldready defined as groups vars
          * It is done to avoid to duplicate list
          * If behin the key provided you have:
              * a list, the values proposed values are the values of the list
              * a dict, the values proposed values are the keys of the dict 
          * The variable are get through a `ansible-inventory --list --export`
          * So it work in all case, groups_vars file, dynamic inventory, ... etc
          * Below some examples.
